\subsection*{Remark on the Archimedean principle}
The Archimedean principle is sometimes stated as :\\
If $x,\,y\in \Breal$ with $y>0$, then $\exists\, n\in \Zed: (n-1)y\leq x < ny$.\\\\
On page $25$, we have \\\\
$\mathbf{30.6}$ \textbf{The least upper bound axiom for the real number system} $\mathbf{\Breal}$.\\
If $S$ is a nonempty subset of $\Breal$ and $S$ has an upper bound, then $S$ has a least upper bound in $\Breal$.\\\\
It is strange that  the author first gives the Archimedean principle as a principle (aka Axiom ?) and afterwards $\mathbf{30.6}$ as an axiom as the Archimedean principle can be proved with this axiom. \\\\
\textbf{Proof} (by contradiction):\\
Be arbitrary $x,\, y\in \Breal$ with $y> 0$. Suppose that we have $py\leq x$ is true for all $p\in \Zed$. Be $A$ the subset of $\Breal$ with all the real numbers $py$ as elements. From axiom $\mathbf{30.6}$ we know that $A$ has a least upper bound with $x$ as an upper bound. Be $\xi= lub(A)$. As we have $y>0$, then $\xi -y$ is not an upper bound of $A$.  This mean that there is a $p$ such that $py>\xi -y$. Hence, $ (p+1)y>\xi$. Thus $\xi$ can not be a upper bound of $A$, and we have a contradiction. Hence, there must be a $p\in \Zed$ for which $py>x$.

Be $A\subset\Qiuu$ such that $A=\{x^2\leq 2,\, x\in \Qiuu\}$. $A$ has upper bounds (e.g.  $sup(A)=2$). This set can be re-expressed as $A= (-\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2})$ and has no $l.u.b.(A)$ as $\sqrt{2}\not \in \Qiuu$.

Prove that the least upper bound property implies the following: If $S$ is a nonempty subset of real numbers that has a lower bound, then $S$ has a greatest lower bound. 
\end{tcolorbox}
Suppose $S$ is a nonempty subset of real numbers that has a lower bound $\mathbcal{s}$. For all $x\in S$ we have $\mathbcal{s}\leq x$. Let's define a new set $\hat{S}$ with $\hat{S}=\{2\mathbcal{s}-x: x\in S\}$. Then, $\mathbcal{s}$ is an upper bound for $\hat{S}$. By the upper bound axiom for real number, we have a $\mathbcal{\hat{s}}= l.u.b.(\hat{S})$ and we have $2\mathbcal{s}-x\leq \mathbcal{\hat{s}}$ for all $x\in S$. And thus, $$2\mathbcal{s}- \mathbcal{\hat{s}}\leq x$$
for all $x\in S$.\\
$2\mathbcal{s}- \mathbcal{\hat{s}}$ is a $g.l.b.(A)$ as, suppose we would have a $\epsilon>0$ such that  $2\mathbcal{s}- \mathbcal{\hat{s}}+\epsilon \leq x$ and thus $\underbrace{2\mathbcal{s}-x}_{\in\hat{S}} \leq \mathbcal{\hat{s}}-\epsilon$ for all $\hat{x}\in \hat{S}$. We get a contradiction as we would have $\mathbcal{\hat{s}}-\epsilon$ as an upper bound which is smaller than $l.u.b.(\hat{S})$.

\end{tcolorbox}
Suppose for a given $\epsilon$,  $\not\exists\,\, x\in A:\, a-\epsilon < x$, then, $x\leq a-\epsilon$. Thus $a-\epsilon$ is a lower bound which is smaller than $l.u.b.(S)$. We have a contradiction and thus $\forall\epsilon\in\Breal, \exists\,\, x\in A:\, a-\epsilon < x \leq a$.\\\\
For $b= g.l.b. (A)$, the statement becomes $$\forall\epsilon\in\Breal, \exists\,\, x\in A:\, b\leq  x < b+\epsilon$$
Suppose for a given $\epsilon$,  $\not\exists\,\, x\in A:\, x < b+\epsilon$, then, $x \leq b+\epsilon$. Thus $b+\epsilon$ is a upper bound which is greater than $g.l.b.(S)$. We have a contradiction and thus $\forall\epsilon\in\Breal, \exists\,\, x\in A:\, b\leq  x < b+\epsilon$.

Prove that if $A$ is a nonempty bounded set of real numbers then $g.l.b. (A) \leq l.u.b. (A)$. For what kind of set $A$ is $g.l.b. (A) =l.u.b. (A)$? 
\end{tcolorbox}
$A$ is bounded, hence by the upper bound property and its corollary (see Exercise 2.30.2) then $A$ has both a $l.u.b.(A)$  and a $g.l.b.(A)$. This mean that for every $x\in A$ we have $l.u.b.(A)\leq x\leq g.l.b.(A)$ and thus $l.u.b.(A)\leq g.l.b.(A)$\\\\
We can have $g.l.b. (A) =l.u.b. (A)$ when $A$ is a singleton, i.e. $A=\{x\}$. E.g. $A=f[\Breal]$ with $f=\{c\}$ with $c$ a constant, has $g.l.b. (A) =l.u.b. (A)=c$ .

\end{tcolorbox}
From $\mathbf{2.30.8}$ we know that $l.u.b.(A)\leq g.l.b.(A)$ and $l.u.b.(B)\leq g.l.b.(B)$. \\\\
Suppose we have $g.l.b.(A)< g.l.b.(B)$. This implies that $\exists\, x\in A: x\not \in B$. We have a contradiction as $A\subset B$ and thus we must have $g.l.b.(B)\leq g.l.b.(A)$.\\
In the same vein, suppose we have $l.u.b.(B)< l.u.b.(A)$. This implies that $\exists\, x\in A: x\not \in B$. We have a contradiction as $A\subset B$ and thus we must have $l.u.b.(A)\leq l.u.b.(B)$. \\
Putting this all together we get indeed
$$g.l.b. (B) \leq g.l.b. (A)\leq  l.u.b. (A) \leq l.u.b. (B)$$

Suppose that $(a_n)$ is a sequence such that $a_n\leq a_{n+1}$, $(a_{n+1}\leq a_{n})$ for each positive integer $n$. Suppose further that the sequence $(a_n)$ is bounded above (below). Then $\lim (a_n)$ exists.

$$ $$ 
$\mathbf{a_n\leq a_{n+1}}$\\\\
As $(a_n)$ is bounded above and is a subset of $\Breal$, then by the upper bound property of $\Breal$, has a lower upper bound, $A=l.u.b.$.\\
We first notice that for any arbitrary $\epsilon\in \Breal$, there must be a $a_N$ such that $A-\epsilon < a_N\leq A$ (as otherwise $A-\epsilon$ would be an upper bound, giving a contradiction).\\
So we have $A-\epsilon < a_N$ and thus $A-a_N < \epsilon$.  Furthermore as $a_{N+k}\geq a_N$ for all $k$ we will have $A-a_{N+k}\leq A-a_N<\epsilon$.  As $\forall n, A\geq a_n $, $A-a_n$ will stay positive for all $n$. Thus, the last result can be written as $|A-a_{N+k}|<\epsilon$ for a chosen $\epsilon$. From the definition of the limit, we conclude that the $\lim (a_n)= l.u.b.(a_n)$ exists.\\\\
$\mathbf{a_{n+1}\leq a_{n}}$\\\\
As $(a_n)$ is bounded below  and is a subset of $\Breal$, then by the corollary of the upper bound property of $\Breal$, has a greatest lower bound, $L=g.l.b.$.\\
We first notice that for any arbitrary $\epsilon\in \Breal$, there must be a $a_N$ such that $L\leq a_N < L+\epsilon$ (as otherwise $L+\epsilon$ would be a lower bound, giving a contradiction).\\
So we have $a_N < L+\epsilon$ and thus $a_N -L < \epsilon$.  Furthermore as $a_{N+k}\leq a_N$ for all $k$ we will have $a_{N+k}-L\leq a_{N}-L<\epsilon$.  As $\forall n, L\leq a_n $, $a_n-L$ will stay positive for all $n$. Thus, the last result can be written as $|L-a_{N+k}|<\epsilon$ for a chosen $\epsilon$. From the definition of the limit, we conclude that the $\lim (a_n)= g.l.b.(a_n)$ exists.

From the definition of the limit of a sequence, for a given $\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ there will be elements $a_N$ and $b_{N^{'}}$ such that for all $n\geq N$ and $n^{'}\geq {N^{'}}$ we will have 
$$|A-a_n|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}\Et |B-b_{n^{'}}|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$$
Let's put $M=sup(N,\,N^{'})$. 
Adding the two inequalities gives 
$$|A-a_m|+|B-b_{m^{}}|<\epsilon$$
for any $m\geq M$.
The triangle inequality of the distance in $\Breal$ states
$$d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z)$$
Put $x= a_m-B,\, z= A-b_m$ and $y= A-B$. The triangle inequality gives $|a_m-B-A+b_m  | \leq |a_m-B-A+B |+|A-b_m -A+B |$ or
$$|a_m+b_m-(A+B)| \leq |A-a_m |+|B-b_m |$$
But $|A-a_m|+|B-b_{m^{}}|<\epsilon$ and get

$$|a_nb_n - AB| = |a_nb_n -a_nB+a_nB-AB| = |a_n(b_n-B)+B(a_n-A)|$$

\begin{tcolorbox}
Give the details of the proof of Theorem $\mathbf{33.1}$.
\end{tcolorbox}
First we note that we have 
\begin{align}
a_1\leq \dots \leq a_n\leq a_{n+1}\leq\dots \leq b_1\\
a_1\leq \dots \leq b_{n+1}\leq b_n \leq\dots \leq b_1
\end{align}
We see that the subset $\{a_n\}\subset\Breal $ is bounded above, and the subset $\{b_n\}\subset\Breal $ is bounded below, hence, by the upper bound principle (and its corollary) in $\Breal$, $\{a_n\}$ has a $l.u.b.$ and  $\{b_n\}$ has a $g.l.b.$ Let's denote them $A$ and $B$ respectively.\\
Be $\epsilon>0$, then there exists a $n_1\in\Pee$ such that  $\forall n\geq n_1 $ we have $A-\epsilon < a_n\leq A$ (as otherwise $A-\epsilon$ would be an upperbound, which is contradictory with the fact that $A$ is a $l.u.b.$
Then, we have as $\epsilon>0$, 
$$A-\epsilon < a_n< A+\epsilon$$ and thus 
\begin{align}|a_n-A|<\epsilon\end{align}
Giving $A=\lim \{a_n\}$\\\\
The same reasoning on the lower bound of $b_n$ gives $B\leq b_n < B+\epsilon$ and thus 
\begin{align}|b_n-B|<\epsilon\end{align}
and $B=\lim \{b_n\}$\\\\
Then we have 
\begin{align}
a_1\leq \dots \leq a_n\leq a_{n+1}\leq\dots \leq A\leq b_1\\
a_1\leq B \leq \dots \leq b_{n+1}\leq b_n \leq\dots \leq b_1
\end{align}
From this we conclude that $A\leq B$. Indeed, suppose we would have $A>B$.\\
From $(5)$ and $(6)$ we can write $(3)$ and $(4)$ as 
\begin{align}
|a_n-A|= A-a_n<\epsilon\quad \forall n\geq n_1\\
|b_n-B|= b_n-B<\epsilon\quad \forall n\geq n_2
\end{align}
Choose $\epsilon = \frac{A-B}{2},\, (>0$ as we supposed $A>B)$ and  $\hat{n}=\max(n_1,\, n_2)$. Adding $(7)$ and $(8)$ gives
\begin{align}
&A-B+ b_n-a_n<\epsilon+\epsilon\\
\implies\quad &A-B+ b_n-a_n <A-B\\
\implies\quad & b_n <a_n
\end{align}
which is impossible as we have $a_n \leq b_n,\, \forall n\in \Pee$.\\\\
Till now, we proved that $A=\lim \{a_n\} $ and $B=\lim \{b_n\}$ exist and that $A\leq B$.\\\\
Consider $[A,\, B]$ and an element $x\in [A,\, B]$. We have 
$$A\leq x\leq B$$
But we know $a_n\leq A\Et b_n\geq B,\, \forall n\in \Pee$ and so we get  
$$a_n\leq A\leq x\leq B\leq b_n$$
and thus $x\in [a_n,b_n]$ and conclude 
$$[A,B]\subset [a_n,b_n],\,  \forall n \in \Pee$$ and we can state
$$\exists\, x\in  \bigcap^{\infty}_{i=1}[a_i,b_i]$$ and thus
$$\bigcap^{\infty}_{i=1}[a_i,b_i]\neq \varnothing$$

We now prove that if $\lim \left(|b_i -a_i|\right)=0$ then $\bigcap^{\infty}_{i=1}[a_i,b_i]$ has exactly one element.\\
Suppose $x,\, y\in \bigcap^{\infty}_{i=1}[a_i,b_i]$, two different elements. Then $| b_i-a_i| \geq |x-y| >0,\, \forall i\in \Pee$ as $x\neq y$. Choose $\epsilon=\frac{|x-y|}{2}$, then 
$| b_i-a_i|  >\epsilon ,\, \forall i\in \Pee$ and thus $|b_i-a_i|$ doe not have a limit. We get a contradiction as we supposed $\lim \left(|b_i -a_i|\right)=0$.

Give an example of nonempty intervals $I_i$ (see $\mathbf{33.2}$) such that 
$$I_1\supset I_2 \supset \dots \supset I_n\supset \dots  \Et \bigcap^{\infty}_{i=1}I_i=\varnothing $$

Choose $I_i=(0,\, 2^{-i})$. Suppose there exists $x\in \bigcap^{\infty}_{i=1}I_i$, then for any $i\in \Pee$, there exists a $n > i$ such that $x\geq 2^{-n}$ and thus $x\not\in I_n$ and hence $x\not\in \bigcap^{\infty}_{i=1}I_i$.\\\\
Thus $$\bigcap^{\infty}_{i=1}I_i=\varnothing $$

Is the following statement true? Given an interval $I$ and a point $p\in I$, there exists a countable collection of closed intervals $\{I_i\}$ such that $p\in I_1\subset I_2\subset I_3\dots \subset I_n\dots $ (possibly only a finite number needed) and such that $I=\bigcup^{\infty}_{i=1}I_i$.
\end{tcolorbox}
Without loss of generalization, put $I=(0,1)$ and $p\in I$. Define, the following collection of closed sets
\begin{align*}
I_n=\left[a_n,\, b_n\right]=\left[\frac{p}{2^n},\, \frac{p+2^n-1}{2^n}\right]
\end{align*}
We have $I_n\subset I_{n+1}$. Indeed,
\begin{align*}
b_{n+1}=\frac{p+2^{n+1}-1}{2^{n+1}}&=\half \frac{p+2.2^{n}-1}{2^{n}}\\
&= \half \frac{2p+2.2^{n}-2+1-p}{2^{n}}\\
&=  \frac{p+2^{n}-1}{2^{n}}+\half \underbrace{\frac{1-p}{2^{n}}}_{>0}\\
&>\frac{p+2^{n}-1}{2^{n}}=b_n
\end{align*}
and also $a_{n+1}=\frac{p}{2^{n+1}}<\frac{p}{2^n}=a_n$ giving $I_n\subset I_{n+1}$.\\\\
Also, for every $n\in\Pee $ we have $a_n=\frac{p}{2^n}>0$ and 
\begin{align*}
b_n=\frac{p+2^{n}-1}{2^{n}}&= \underbrace{\frac{p-1}{2^{n}}}_{<0}+1\\
&< 1
\end{align*}
Moreover $a_n< p,\, \forall p\in \Pee$ and 
\begin{align*}
b_n-p&=\frac{p+2^{n}-1}{2^{n}}-p\\
&= \frac{p+2^{n}-1-2^np}{2^{n}}\\
&= \frac{(2^{n}-1)-(2^n-1)p}{2^{n}}\\
&= \underbrace{\frac{(2^{n}-1)}{2^{n}}}_{>0}\underbrace{(1-p)}_{>0}\\
&>0\\
\implies \quad b_n&>p
\end{align*}
So $I_n$  are closed intervals containing $p$ and for which we have,
$$p\in I_1\subset I_2\subset I_3\dots \subset I_n\dots $$
and 
$$I_n\subset I,\, \forall n\in \Pee$$\\
Obviously, the collection of $I_n$ is countable as $n\in \Pee$ and $\Pee$ is countable.
\\\\
We now prove that 
$$I=\bigcup^{\infty}_{i=1}I_i $$
Suppose we have $x\in I$, then, $$\exists\, \hat{n}\in \Pee,\, \frac{p}{2^{\hat{n}}}\leq x\leq \frac{p+2^{\hat{n}}-1}{2^{\hat{n}}}$$
Indeed, it suffice to take $\hat{n}= max(\log_2 \frac{p}{x},\, \log_2 \frac{1-p}{1-x})$ with $\hat{n}\in\Pee$.\\
So, for every $x\in I$ we can find a closed interval containing $x$ and thus $$I\subset  \bigcup^{\infty}_{i=1}I_i$$
and as $I_i\subset I,\, \forall i\in \Pee$ we have also 
$$\bigcup^{\infty}_{i=1}I_i\subset  I$$
giving
$$I=\bigcup^{\infty}_{i=1}I_i$$

Suppose that $\mathscr{K}$ is a collection of intervals such that $\bigcap\mathscr{K}\neq \varnothing$. Is $\bigcup\mathscr{K}$ necessarily an interval?
\end{tcolorbox}
Be $a\in \bigcup \mathscr{K}\Et b\in \bigcup \mathscr{K}$. Consider the closed interval $[a,\, b]$. Is it possible that $[a,\, b]\not \subset \bigcup \mathscr{K}$?\\\\
$[a,\, b]\not \subset \bigcup \mathscr{K}$ would mean that $\exists\, x\in [a,\, b]$ such that $x\not\in \bigcup \mathscr{K}$.\\
As $a\in \bigcup \mathscr{K}$ there exists at least one interval $K_a\in \mathscr{K}$ such that $a\in K_a$. In the same way $\exists\, K_b\in\mathscr{K}$ for which we have $b\in K_b$.\\\\
If we have $a\in K_a$ and also $b\in K_a$, then we can put $K_a=K_b$ with the consequence that  $x\in K_a$ as $K_a$ is an interval and hence $\forall a,\, b\in K_a, [a,\, b]\subset K_a$.\\
Hence, $x$ will also be an element of $\bigcup \mathscr{K}$ and we get $[a,\, b]\subset \bigcup \mathscr{K}$.\\\\
Suppose now, $K_a\neq K_b$. As we suppose $x\in [a,\, b]$, but $x\not\in K_a$ and $x\not\in K_b$ we will have 
$$a<x<b\quad(\text{compared to } a\leq x\leq b)$$
As $a$ and $b$ are arbitrary (insofar $a\in K_a$ and $b\in K_b$) and $x\not \in K_a\cup K_b$, we get $$K_a\cap K_b=\varnothing$$
This is not possible as we have $\bigcap\mathscr{K}\neq \varnothing$ and thus $x$ must be an element of $\bigcup \mathscr{K}$ implying $[a,\, b]\subset \bigcup \mathscr{K}$.\\\\
\textbf{Conclusion}: Provided that we have $\bigcap\mathscr{K}\neq \varnothing$ , $\bigcup \mathscr{K}$ is indeed an interval

Consider the triangle $\triangle \left(z,\,x,\, (x-z)+ (y-z)\right)$. From trigonometry we have 
\begin{align}
|x-z|^2+|y-z|^2&= |x-z+ y-z|^2+2|x-z||y-z|\cos \beta
\end{align}
where $\beta$ is the inner angle at $x$.
We have 
\begin{align*}
|x-z+ y-z|^2= |x-z|^2+|y-z|^2+2(x-z)(y-z)

and can write $(1)$ as 
\begin{align*}
|x-z|^2+|y-z|^2&= |x-z|^2+|y-z|^2+2(x-z)(y-z)+2|x-z||y-z|\cos \beta\\

From geometry we have $2\alpha+2\beta = 2\pi$ and thus $\cos\beta = \cos (\pi-\alpha)= -\cos\alpha$, giving

&=|x|^2+p^2|y|^2+2p(x.y)

As $p$ is arbitrary, choose $p= -\frac{(x.y)}{|y|^2}$ and substitute in $(3)$, we get 
\begin{align*}
0&\leq|x|^2-\frac{(x.y)^2}{|y|^2}-\frac{(x.y)^2}{|y|^4}|y|^2\\
&= |x|^2|y|^2-(x.y)^2
\end{align*}
from which we get 
$$(x.y)^2\leq |x|^2|y|^2$$
Taking the positive square root:
$$|x.y|\leq |x||y|$$
\textit{Note that we have also $(x.y)\leq |x.y|\leq |x||y|$ as $(x.y)$ can be negative}.
$$\lozenge$$
\begin{align*}
|x+y|^2&= (x+y).(x+y)\\

&\leq |x|^2+|y|^2+2|x||y|\quad\text{ (by the previous inequality)}\\
&= \left(|x|+|y|\right)^2

Taking again the positive square root, we get 
$$|x+y|\leq |x|+|y|$$

Suppose $S$ is a nonempty open subset of $\Breal^n$. Is every point of $S$ a limit point of $S$? Give an example of an open nonempty subset of $\Breal^n$ that contains all of its limit points.
\end{tcolorbox}
$S$ is a nonempty open subset of $\Breal^n$ so we have for any $p\in S$,
$$\exists\, \, \epsilon>0: N(p;\epsilon)\subset S$$
We prove that 
$$\forall p\in S, \exists\, \, \epsilon>0: N(p;\epsilon)\subset S \implies \forall p\in S, \forall\, \epsilon^{'}>0: \left(N(p;\epsilon^{'})-\{p\}\right)\cap S\neq \varnothing $$
Be an arbitrary $\epsilon^{'}>0$ . Besides the obvious case $\epsilon^{'}=\epsilon$, we examine the two cases $\epsilon^{'}>\epsilon$ and $\epsilon^{'}<\epsilon$.\\\begin{figure}[H]%

\caption{$\epsilon$-neighbourhood for the open non empty set $S$   }

$i)\quad \mathbf{\epsilon^{'}>\epsilon}$\\\\
In that case we will have $N(p;\epsilon)\subset N(p;\epsilon^{'})$. This means that $N(p;\epsilon)\cap S \subset N(p;\epsilon^{'})\cap S$ and as $N(p;\epsilon)\cap S = N(p;\epsilon)\neq \varnothing$ we conclude $N(p;\epsilon^{'})\cap S\neq \varnothing$.\\\\
$ii)\quad \mathbf{\epsilon}>\epsilon^{'}$\\\\
In that case we will have $N(p;\epsilon^{'})\subset N(p;\epsilon)$. As $N(p;\epsilon)\subset S$ we also have $N(p;\epsilon^{'})\subset S$ and conclude $N(p;\epsilon^{'})\cap S\neq \varnothing$.\\\\
So, for all cases of $\epsilon^{'}$ we get the conclusion 
$$\forall p\in S, \forall\, \epsilon^{'}>0: N(p;\epsilon^{'})\cap S\neq \varnothing $$ Can we prove that also
\begin{align}
\forall p\in S, \forall\, \epsilon^{'}>0: \left(N(p;\epsilon^{'})-\{p\}\right)\cap S\neq \varnothing
\end{align}
Suppose, 
$$\forall p\in S, \forall\, \epsilon^{'}>0: \left(N(p;\epsilon^{'})-\{p\}\right)\cap S= \varnothing $$
This means that $p$ would be the only element common to $N(p;\epsilon^{'})$ and $S$. This is not possible as $\epsilon^{'}$ being greater than $0$ means that $N(p;\epsilon^{'})$ contains other elements than $p$ and as $N(p;\epsilon^{'})\subset S$ these other elements must also belong to $S$, hence $\left(N(p;\epsilon^{'})-\{p\}\right)\cap S \neq \varnothing $ and conclude that $(1)$ is a true statement and thus $p$ is a limit point of $S$. As $p$ was arbitrary chosen, this yields for all elements of $S$ and thus every point of $S$ is a limit point of $S$.

In $\Breal^2$, take the open subsets $K_n=\{x:|x-(\half,0)|<\frac{2^n-1}{2^{n+1}},\, n\in \Pee\}$ and $\mathscr{K}=\{K_n,\,n\in \Pee \}$. This set for $\Breal^2$ is illustrated in the figure above.\\\\
$\hat{O}=(0,0)$ is a limit point for $\bigcup \mathscr{K}$. \\
Indeed, choose an arbitrary $\epsilon >0$. If $\hat{O}$ is a limit point of $\bigcup \mathscr{K}$, then we must have 
$$\forall \epsilon :\left(N(\hat{O};\epsilon)-\{\hat{O}\}\right)\cap \bigcup \mathscr{K}\neq \varnothing$$ Consider a point $(x,0)\in K_n\subset \bigcup \mathscr{K} $. We have $|x-\half|<\frac{2^n-1}{2^{n+1}}$ or 
\begin{align}
-\frac{2^n-1}{2^{n+1}}<&x-\half<\frac{2^n-1}{2^{n+1}}\\
\Leftrightarrow\quad  \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}<&x<1-\frac{1}{2^{n+1}}

Consider the points $(x^{'},0)\in N(\hat{O};\epsilon)$. We have $|x^{'}|<\epsilon$ or 
\begin{align*}
-\epsilon<&x^{'}<\epsilon

and for $\left(N(\hat{O};\epsilon)-\{\hat{O}\}\right)$, considering only the positive $x^{'}$'s
\begin{align}
0<&x^{'}<\epsilon
\end{align}
Considering $(2)$ and $(3)$, we can always find a $n$ such that $\frac{1}{2^{n+1}}<\epsilon$. Hence  $\left(N(\hat{O};\epsilon)-\{\hat{O}\}\right)\cap K_n= \left(\frac{1}{2^{n+1}},\epsilon\right)\neq \varnothing$ and thus as $K_n\subset  \bigcup \mathscr{K}$ we have
$$\forall \epsilon :\left(N(\hat{O};\epsilon)-\{\hat{O}\}\right)\cap \bigcup \mathscr{K}\neq \varnothing$$.\\\\
On the other hand, for a given $K_n\in \mathscr{K}$ it is clear that $\hat{O}$ is not a limit point as we can always find an $\epsilon < \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}$, meaning that $K_n$ and $\left(N(\hat{O};\epsilon)-\{\hat{O}\}\right)$ have no common points, hence, $\hat{O}$ is not a limit point of $K_n$.

(f) Then since $z\not\in S$, $z$ is a limit point of $S$.\\

(g) Since $\epsilon - d(x, z) > 0$ and $z$ is a limit point of $S$, there is a point $y\in S$ such that

\begin{align*}
&\neg\left(\forall \epsilon >0,\left(N(p;\epsilon)-\{p\}\right)\cap S\neq \varnothing\right)\\

\Leftrightarrow\quad &\exists\,\, \epsilon >0,N(p;\epsilon)\cap S= \varnothing
\end{align*}
The last statement follows from the fact that $p\not\in S$, hence the presence of $p$ in $N(p;\epsilon)$ is of no object for the statement.
By the last statement , $N(p;\epsilon)\not\subset S$ and thus $N(p;\epsilon)$ lies completely in the complement of $S$ and we get for any arbitrary $p\in(\sim S)$:
$$\exists\,\, \epsilon >0,N(p;\epsilon)\subset (\sim S)$$

The presence of $q$ in $N(q;\epsilon)$ does not change the last statement and we have
$$\exists\,\,\epsilon >0, \left(N(q;\epsilon)-\{q\}\right)\cap S=\varnothing$$
We have a contradiction as we supposed that $q$ was a limit point of $S$, hence the supposition that $q$ is not in $S$ is wrong. So a limit point of $S$ must be in $S$ and thus $S$ is closed.

If $x \not \in \, S^{'}$, then  $x$ is not a limit point of $S$

Since $\epsilon - d(x, z) > 0$ and $z$ is a limit point of $S$, there is a point $y\in S$ such that

Consider $S=\{p\}$ a set in $\Breal^n$ consisting of a single point. Then, $\forall \epsilon > 0, \, N(p; \epsilon)\cap S = \{p\}(\neq \varnothing)$, which implies that $p\in F$. Also, $N(p;\epsilon)\cap \left(\sim S\right)\neq \varnothing$ as $N(p;\epsilon)-\{p\}$ contains only elements of $\sim S$. Also, no other element $q$ of $\sim S$ can comply with the condition $\forall \epsilon > 0, \, N(q; \epsilon)\cap S \neq \varnothing$ and hence $F=S$.

Recall the definition of a line segment $L(a,b)$ determined by $a \Et b$:\\
$$L=\{x:x=(1-t)a+tb,\, t\in \Breal_{[0,1]}\}$$
Be a $p$ a limit point of the line $L(a,b)$. Then, $\forall \epsilon: \left( N(p;\epsilon)-\{p\}\right)\cap L(a,b)\neq \varnothing$. This means that $\exists\, x\in L(a,b)$ which is also an element of $N(p;\epsilon)$. This implies 
$$ d(p;x)<\epsilon$$
Suppose that $p\not\in L(a,b)$. This implies
$$\not\exists\,\, t\in\Breal : p= (1-t)a+bt$$
Consider the set $$D=\{d=d(p;x):x= (1-t)a+bt,\forall t\in\Breal \}$$
As $p\not\in L(a,b)$, the ordered set $(D,\leq)\subset (\Breal,\leq)$ does not contain the element $d=0$, hence $D$ has a lower bound $=0\not \in D$.\
By the least upper bound axiom on page $\mathbf{61}$ and it's corollary (exercise $2$ page $62$) $D$ has a greatest lower bound. Be $g.l.b\,  D=\delta$. We have 
$$0<\delta$$ and thus 
$$\forall\epsilon >0: 0<\delta \leq d(p;x)<\epsilon$$
But this inequality must be true for any $\epsilon>0$. We get a contradiction as this inequality can't be satisfied for $0<\epsilon <\delta$ and thus our assumption the $p\not\in L(a,b)$ is false.

In the book, an $\epsilon=1$ is taken to prove that a convergent sequence is bounded. But any positive number can be chosen to prove the boundness as seen in the figure $2.6$.\\
The sequence begins with $a_1$ and we choose an arbitrary $\delta_k$. As the sequence is convergent this means that for this $\epsilon= \delta_k$ there must be a positive integer $k$ such that $d(L;a_i)<\delta_k$ for all $i>k+1$. And, if we take as $M=max \{d(a_i,L):i\in \Pee\}$ then $\forall i\in \Pee, \forall \delta_M>0: d(a_i,L)< M+\delta_m$

\subsection*{Remark on Theorem 41.4 on the convergence of a subsequence of a bounded sequence}

Proof.
 \textit{Suppose the range of $(a_i)$ is a finite set. Then there is a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers $(n_i)$ and a point $z \in\Breal^n$ such that $a_{n_i}=z$ for 
$i\in\Pee$. Hence, $\lim (a_{n_i} ) =z$ and we are through.}
\\
As an example take the sequence in $\Breal^2$ defined by
$$a_i=\left(\sin{\left(\frac{2\pi}{T}i\right)},\cos{\left(\frac{2\pi}{T}i\right)}\right)\text{ with } T\in \Pee, i\in \Pee$$
Then the range of the (bounded) sequence is finite with $T$ possible values. Define the subsequence by defining the map 
$$n_i= T(i-1)+T^{'}\text{ with } T^{'}\in\Pee \Et T^{'}\leq T$$  will map $a_{n_i}$ on one of the $T$ values and we have a convergent sequence with $a_{n_i}= C^t\quad \forall n_i$.
$$\lozenge$$\\
\textit{Next suppose the range $S$ of
$(a_i)$ is an infinite set. By the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem there is a point $z$ that is a limit point of $S$. (We shall find a subsequence $(a_{n_i})$ of $(a_i)$ by choosing for each
$i\in \Pee$, an $(a_{n_i})$such that $d(a_{n_i} , z) < \frac{1}{i}$. However, we must be careful to choose these in such a way that $(n_i)$ is a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers. We shall do this inductively.) \\\\
Since $z$ is a limit point of $S$, there is a positive integer such that}
$$0 < d(a_{n_1}, z) < 1$$
\textit{Assume that for $1,2,\dots, h$, increasing integers ${n_1},{n_2},\dots,{n_h}$ have been chosen
such that}
$$0 < d(a_{n_i}, z) < \frac{1}{i}$$
\textbf{\textit{Since $S\cap N\left(z;\frac{1}{i+1}\right)$ is an infinite set (see Exercise 7, page 71 ), there is an integer $n_{h+1}$ such that $n_{h} < n_{h+1}$ and for which $d(a_{n_{h+1}}, z) < \frac{1}{h+1}$.} }
\begin{mdframed}
Is it so obvious that there is an integer $n_{h+1}$ such that $n_{h} < n_{h+1}$ and for which $d(a_{n_{h+1}}, z) < \frac{1}{h+1}$?\\
By assumption we have a set $K=\{a_{n_1},a_{n_2},\dots,a_{n_h}\}$ such that $0 < d(a_{n_i}, z) < \frac{1}{i}$. As $U= S\cap N\left(z;\frac{1}{i+1}\right)$ is an infinite set $U-K$ still will be an infinite set because $K$ is a finite set.\\
So, is it possible that for all elements $a_{n_p}\in U-K$ we have $n_p<n_h$? The answer is definitely negative, as the number of 'available slots' in the set $\{1,2,\dots,n_h\}$ is finite. Hence after excluding all $n_j$ such that $n_j<n_h$ we will still be able to find an infinite number of $n_k > n_h: k\geq h+1$ for which $d(a_{n_{k}}, z) < \frac{1}{k}:\quad n_k > n_h$
\end{mdframed}
\textit{Hence, by induction (see $18.4$), a strictly increasing sequence of integers $n_{i}$ has been chosen
such that $d(a_{n_{i}}, z) < \frac{1}{i}$. It is clear from the way in which the integers $(n_i)$ were
chosen that $(a_{n_i} )$ is a subsequence of $(a_{i} )$ and that $\lim (a_{n_i}) = z$.}

Prove that if $S$ is a subset of $\Breal^n$ and $z \in \Breal^n$, then $z$ is a limit point of $S$ if and only if there exists a sequence $(a_i)$ in $S$ that converges to $z$ and which is such that $a_i\neq a_j$ for $i\neq j$.
\end{tcolorbox}
We have to prove
$$\forall \epsilon >0: \left(N(z;\epsilon)-\{z\}\right)\cap S\neq\varnothing\quad \iff\quad \exists\, \quad(a_i)\text{ in } S: a_i\neq a_j \text{ for } i\neq j \Et \lim a_i= z$$\\\\
$$\lozenge$$\\
$$\mathbf{\mathlarger{\implies}}$$
We have that $z$ is a limit point. So, 
\begin{align}
\forall \epsilon >0: \left(N(z;\epsilon)-\{z\}\right)\cap S\neq\varnothing
\end{align}
Let's put $\epsilon =1$ and denote 
$$D_1=\left(N(z;1)-\{z\}\right)\cap S$$
Then we can write $D_1$ as
 \begin{align}
 D_1=\{ x\in S: d(x,z)<1\}
 \end{align}
 We know that $D_1$ is an infinite set (see Exercise 7, page 71 ).\\
 Let's define 
 \begin{align}
 \mathscr{D}_1=\{d(x,z): x\in D_1\}
 \end{align}
 Obviously $\mathscr{D}_1\subset \Breal$ and is (upper) bounded and is a linearly ordered subset of $\Breal$. Using Zorn's Lemmma (page 47) we know that $\mathscr{D}_1$ has a maximal element in $\mathscr{D}_1$. Let's choose the element $a_1$ of $D_1$ for which $d(a_1,z)=\max \mathscr{D}_1$ ($a_1$ is unique as $S$, being a set, will contain only one element of the same object).\\
 Consider now 
 \begin{align}
 D_2=\{ x\in S: 0<d(x,z)<\frac{1}{2}\}-\{a_1\}
 \end{align}
 $D_2$ is still infinite. Let's repeat the procedure initiated in $(3)$ by defining $ \mathscr{D}_2=\{d(x,z): x\in D_2\}$ etc.. and choose an element $a_2$ such that $d(a_2,z)=\max \mathscr{D}_2$.\\
 Repeating this procedure gives us a sequence
  \begin{align}
 \{(1,a_1), (2,a_2),\dots, (i,a_i),\dots\}\text{ such that }0< d(a_i,z)<\frac{1}{i}\text{ for } i\in \Pee 
 \end{align}
The definition of convergence of a sequence $(a_i)$ to $z$  is:
$$\forall\epsilon > 0, \exists\, N\in\Pee:\, d(a_k,z) <\epsilon \text{ whenever } k \geq N $$
If we choose an arbitrary $\epsilon>0$ it suffice in $(5)$ to put $\frac{1}{i}\leq \epsilon$ or $i\geq \frac{1}{\epsilon}$ to see that the sequence in $(5)$ converges to $z$.\\\\
Finally, by the way we constructed  the sequence by defining the different subsets $D_k$ as $$D_k=\{ x\in S: 0<d(x,z)<\frac{1}{k}\}-\{a_1,\dots,a_{k-1}\}  $$ we are assured that $a_i\neq a_j$ for $i\neq j$.
$$\lozenge$$\\
$$\mathbf{\mathlarger{\Leftarrow}}$$
We know that for the sequence $(a_i)$ we have 
\begin{align}
\lim a_i= z\quad\Et a_i\neq a_j \text{ for } i\neq j
\end{align}
this implies
\begin{align}
\forall\epsilon > 0, \exists\, N\in\Pee:\, d(a_k,z) <\epsilon \text{ whenever } k \geq N
\end{align}
The requirement $a_i\neq a_j \text{ for } i\neq j$ in $(6)$ makes that if $z$ occurs in the sequence, it can only occur once. Be $M$ the position in the sequence were $z$ occurs, then the subsequence $(a_k):k> M$ will still converges to $z$ (construct the subsequence $(i,a_i): i>M$ and replace $N$ in $(7)$ by $N-M$).\\
So, $(7)$ can be replaced by 
\begin{align}
\forall\epsilon > 0, \exists\, N\in\Pee:\, 0< d(a_k,z) <\epsilon \text{ whenever } k \geq N
\end{align}
which is equivalent to state as 
$\forall \epsilon >0: \left(N(z;\epsilon)-\{z\}\right)\cap S\neq\varnothing$

 Suppose $(a_i)$ is a sequence in $\Breal^n$ that has the following property:
For each $\epsilon > 0$, there is an integer $N$ such that $d(a_m, a_n) < \epsilon$
for $m\geq N $ and $n\geq N$. Show that $(a_i$) is a bounded sequence.
\end{tcolorbox}
The given property of the sequence can be stated as
\begin{align}
\forall \epsilon >0, \, \exists\,\, N\in\Pee: d(a_m,a_n) <\epsilon,\, m\geq N\Et n\geq N
\end{align}
If the sequence is bounded then we have
\begin{align}
\exists\, M>0: d(a_m,a_n) \leq M,\,  \forall m,\, n \in \Pee
\end{align}
Note that by $(1)$, choosing an $\epsilon$ (giving a $N$), and putting $\epsilon = M$ the statement$(2)$ is true on a subsequence of $(a_n)$ i.e. when $ m\geq N\Et n\geq N$. What about the finite subsequence $(a_k): k< N$? Can we be sure that
\begin{align}
\exists\, M^{'}>0: d(a_m,a_n) \leq M^{'},\,  m< N  \Et n< N
\end{align}
Yes, as $K=\{(d(a_m,a_n) ,\,  m< N  \Et n< N\}$ is a finite subset of $\Breal$ and hence is a totally ordered finite set. Therefore (being finite) has a first and last element $L$ and $M^{'}$ with the property that $L\leq d(a_m,a_n)\leq M^{'}$
 for all $d(a_m,a_n)$ in $K$. So $K$ is bounded by $L$ and $M^{'}$. \\
 So, choosing $\hat{M}= \max (M,M^{'})$ the statement in $(2)$ is true.

Prove that a subset $S$ of $\Breal^n$ is closed and bounded if and only if
every sequence in $S$ has a convergent subsequence whose limit
is a point in $S$.
\end{tcolorbox}
$$\mathbf{\mathlarger{\implies}}$$
We know that $S$ is bounded. Hence, any sequence $(a_i)$ with $a_i\in S$ will also be bounded and by theorem $\mathbf{41.4.}$ there is a subsequence $(a_{n_i})$ of $(a_i)$ that converges. So, the existence of a convergent subsequence has been proven.
This means, if this subsequence converges to $a$:
\begin{align}
\forall \epsilon>0,\, \exists\, N\in\Pee: d(a_{n_i},a)<\epsilon,\, n_i\geq N
\end{align}
What is also given, is that $S$ is closed. This means that a limit point $p\in S$ (as $S$ is closed) exists for which yields
\begin{align*}
\forall\epsilon>0: \left(N(p;\epsilon)-\{p\}\right)\cap S\neq \varnothing
\end{align*}
Can we prove that $a$ must be a limit point of $S$?\\\\
From $(1)$ we see that the set $A= \{a_{n_i}: n_i\geq N\}$ is a subset of $N(a;\epsilon)$ and as $A\subset S$ we will have
\begin{align*}
\forall\epsilon>0: N(a;\epsilon)\cap S\neq \varnothing
\end{align*}
 We can not conclude without further arguments that $N(a;\epsilon)-\{a\}\neq \varnothing$. Indeed consider the case where $a_{n_i}=a,\, n_i\geq N$ . But this case is trivial as $a_{n_i}=a,\, n_i\geq N$ is an element of $S$ and thus $a\in S$ (in this case, the requirement  $S$ is closed  is not necessary).\\\\
Consider now the case $\exists\, n_k\in \Pee: a_{n_i}\neq a,\, n_k\geq N$. This implies that the $\epsilon$-neighbourhood $N(a;\epsilon)$ contains at least one element different from $a$ and thus we have indeed
\begin{align*}
\forall\epsilon>0: \left(N(a;\epsilon)-\{a\}\right)\cap S\neq \varnothing
\end{align*}
meaning that in that case $a$ is a limit point of $S$ and $S$ being closed, $a$ is a point of $S$, proving the proposed statement.\newpage
$$\mathbf{\mathlarger{\Leftarrow}}$$
We first prove that $S$ must be bounded.\\
Suppose $S$ is unbounded. This means
\begin{align}
&\neg\left(\exists\, M\in\Breal:\forall x,y\in S,\, d(x,y)\leq M\right)\\
\implies\quad &\forall M\in\Breal,\exists\, x,y\in S:\, d(x,y)> M
\end{align}
We know that $a\in S$ and so we can put $y=a$ and write  $(3)$ as 
\begin{align*}
\forall M\in\Breal,\exists\, x,\in S:\, d(a,x)> M
\end{align*}
In the supposition that $S$ in not bounded, we are able to consider the set $D=\{ x\in S|d(a,x)>M\}$ and construct a sequence $(a_i)\text{ with } a_i\in D$. This sequence has a convergent subsequence $(a_{n_i})$ for which we have 
\begin{align*}
\forall \epsilon>0,\exists\, N\in\Pee: d(a,a_{n_i})<\epsilon,\quad  n_i\geq N
\end{align*}
remember that the elements $(a_{n_i})$ are elements of $D$ for which we have 
$$d(a,a_{n_i})>M$$
with $M$ an arbitrary value in $\Breal$. This means that it also true for $\epsilon =M$. We get a contradiction as we would have at the same time $d(a,a_{n_i}) >M$ and $d(a,a_{n_i})<M$.\\\\
\textbf{Conclusion: $S$ is bounded.}\\\\
$$\lozenge$$
We now want to prove that:\\\\
If $z$ is a limit point of $S$ than we can find a sequence in $S$ such that a subsequence of it converges to $z$ or stated in another way: all limit points of $S$ are limits of sequences in $S$. \\
(\textit{But the converse of the latter is not necessary true. Indeed, consider $S=\{p\}$ i.e. a singleton. Obviously, $S$ has no limit point - and thus is closed - yet, we can construct a convergent sequence $(a_i)$ with $a_i=a,\forall i\in \Pee$. This sequence converges to $a$ but $a$ is not a  limit point of $S$!})
$$\bullet$$

Suppose $z$ is a limit point of $S$. We will try to prove that then we can find a sequence in $S$ who has a subsequence that converges to $z$. As this limit of the sequence is in $S$ (by assumption), then $S$ will be closed .\\\\
An element $z\in\Breal^n$ is a limit point of $S\subset \Breal^n$ provided that 
\begin{align*}
\forall \epsilon>0: \left(N(z;\epsilon)-\{z\}\right)\cap S\neq \varnothing
\end{align*}
We know (see Exercise $7$ page $71$) that $B=N(z;\epsilon)\cap S$ is an infinite set. Hence choose an arbitrary set $B^{'}\subset B$ and define a sequence $(b_i)$ out of the elements of $B$. We know that we then have a convergent subsequence $(b_{n_i})$ for which we have $\lim (b_{n_i}) = a$, which means
\begin{align*}
\forall\epsilon>0, \exists\, N\in\Pee: d(a,b_{n_i})< \epsilon ,\, n_i\geq N
\end{align*}
But we also know that by construction, the elements $b_{n_i}\in N(z;\epsilon)$ and thus 
\begin{align}
\forall\epsilon>0: d(z,b_{n_i})< \epsilon ,\, \forall\,  b_{n_i}
\end{align}
As $(4)$ is true for all $b_{n_i},\, n_i\in\Pee$, it will also be true for the $b_{n_i},\, n_i\geq N$ and get $d(z,b_{n_i})< \epsilon$ and $d(a,b_{n_i})< \epsilon$ and thus $a=z$. \\
Indeed, suppose $a\ne z\,\implies\, d(a,z)=\delta >0$ and choose an arbitrary $\epsilon <\frac{\delta}{3}$ e.g. $\epsilon =\frac{\delta}{3}$, then
\begin{align*}
d(a,z)&\leq d(a,b_{n_i})+d(z,b_{n_i})\\
\implies\quad\delta&<\frac{\delta}{3}+\frac{\delta}{3}\\
\implies\quad 1&<\frac{2}{3}
\end{align*}
which is of course a false statement, so $\delta$ mus be zero and we conclude $a=z$. As $a$ is a limit of a sequence and by assumption an element of $S$ we may conclude that all limit points of  $S$ are also limits of a convergent sequence with a limit in $S$. \\\\\
\textbf{Conclusion: $S$ is closed.}

&= \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^n \left(B_{,j}-b_{i,j}\right)^2}+\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^n \left(A_{,j}-(a_{i,j}\right)^2}\\
&= d(A,a_i)+d(B,b_i)
\end{align*}
We know that $d(A,a_i)<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ and $d(B,b_i)<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ for all $\epsilon >0$ and for $i\geq max(N_a,N_b)$ where $N_a,\, N_b\in \Pee$ are the indices in the sequences from which on the inequalities are true. Hence we get 
\begin{align*}
d(A+B,a_i+b_i)&\leq d(A,a_i)+d(B,b_i)\\
&<\epsilon\quad \forall\epsilon,\quad i\geq max(N_a,N_b)
\end{align*}
So $ \lim (a_i) + \lim (b_i)=\lim (c_i=a_i+b_i) $ if $(a_i)$ and $(b_i)$ converge. (In the case that we know that e.g. $(a_i)$ and $(c_i)$ converge it suffice to put $ \lim (a_i) + \lim (-c_i)=\lim (-b_i) $).

Show directly from the definition that the sequence $\left(\frac{1}{i}\right)$ satisfies the Cauchy criterion.

We have $d(a_{i+k}, a_{i})=|\frac{1}{i+k}-\frac{1}{i}|\leq \frac{1}{i+k}+\frac{1}{i} $.\\
For a given $\epsilon>0$ chose an $N$ such that $\frac{1}{N}<\frac{\epsilon}{2} $. We then will also have $\frac{1}{N+1}<\frac{\epsilon}{2} $ and get $d(a_{i+k}, a_{i})<\frac{1}{i+1}+\frac{1}{i}<\epsilon,\quad i\geq N$. Hence  $\left(\frac{1}{i}\right)$ converges.

\end{tcolorbox}
Be $k\in\Pee$, we have :
\begin{align*}
d(x_{n+k}, x_{n})&\leq d(x_{n+k}, x_{n+k-1})+d( x_{n+k-1}, x_{n})\\\\

\end{align*}
giving
\begin{align}
d(x_{n+k}, x_{n})&\leq \sum_{i=0}^{k-1}d(x_{n+k-i}, x_{n+k-i-1})
\end{align}
\newpage
Lemma : 
\begin{align}
d(x_{i}, x_{i-1})=\frac{1}{2^{i-2}}|b-a|
\end{align}
We prove this by induction:\\\\
For $i= 2$ we have $\frac{1}{2^{i-2}}|b-a|=|b-a|$.\\\\
Suppose that indeed : $d(x_{i-1}, x_{i-2})=\frac{1}{2^{i-3}}|b-a|$.\\
Then
\begin{align*}
d(x_{i}, x_{i-1})&=\left|x_{i}-x_{i-1}\right|\\\\
&=\left|\half(x_{i-1}+x_{i-2})-x_{i-1}\right|\\\\
&=\half\underbrace{\left|x_{i-1}-x_{i-2})\right|}_{= d(x_{i-1}, x_{i-2})=\frac{1}{2^{i-3}}|b-a|}\\\\
&=\frac{1}{2^{i-2}}|b-a|
\end{align*}
$$\lozenge$$
Hence $(1)$ becomes
\begin{align*}
d(x_{n+k}, x_{n})&\leq \sum_{i=0}^{k-1}d(x_{n+k-i}, x_{n+k-i-1})\\
&= \sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\frac{1}{2^{n+k-i-2}}|b-a|\\
&= \frac{|b-a|}{2^{n-2}}\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\frac{1}{2^{k-i}}\\
&= \frac{|b-a|}{2^{n-2}}\half\sum_{j=1}^{k}\frac{1}{2^{j}}\\
&= \frac{|b-a|}{2^{n-1}}\left(2-\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}\right)\\
&< \frac{|b-a|}{2^{n-1}}\left(2\right)\\
&= \frac{|b-a|}{2^{n}}
\end{align*}
So for a given $\epsilon>0$ it suffice to chose $n$ such that  $\frac{|b-a|}{2^{n}}<\epsilon$ and the Cauchy criterion is fulfilled.

\implies\quad & \forall k\in\Pee_n: d(x_{m,k},x_{p,k})<\epsilon,\quad m,\, p\geq M

\end{align*}
For $\Breal$ we have $d(x_{m,k},x_{p,k})=\left|x_{m,k}-x_{p,k}\right|$ and all quantities being positive in both sides of the inequality we can write
\begin{align*}
\forall \frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{n}},\,\exists\, M\in\Pee: d^2(x_{m,k},x_{p,k})=\left|x_{m,k}-x_{p,k}\right|^2<\frac{\epsilon^2}{n},\quad m,\, p\geq M

Summing all these inequalities over $n$ gives

Suppose that $(a_n)$ is a sequence in $\Breal^n$ that satisfies the following property.\\\\ There exists a $\theta$, where $0\leq\theta<1$, such that for each $n \in\Pee,\,  d(a_{n+1},a_{n+2})<\theta d(a_{n},a_{n+1})$. Show that $(a_n)$
converges.
\end{tcolorbox}
From the property of $(a_n)$ we have for $n=1$
$$d(a_{2},a_{3})<\theta d(a_{1},a_{2})$$
Let's put $d(a_{1},a_{2})=\Delta$, then by iteration we see that 
\begin{align}
d(a_{n+1},a_{n+2})<\theta^n\Delta
\end{align}
In the Cauchy criterion, let's put for a given $a_n$, $a_m= a_{n+k}$ (as the distance is symmetric in both elements, we can switch $n$ and $m$ such that we always have $k\geq 0$).\\
We have 
\begin{align*}
d(a_{n+1},a_{n+k})&\leq d(a_{n+1},a_{n+2})+d(a_{n+2},a_{n+k})\\
&\leq d(a_{n+1},a_{n+2})+d(a_{n+2},a_{n+3})+d(a_{n+3},a_{n+k})\\

&\leq d(a_{n+1},a_{n+2})+d(a_{n+2},a_{n+3})+d(a_{n+3},a_{n+k})+\dots +d(a_{n+k-2},a_{n+k-1})+d(a_{n+k-1},a_{n+k}) 
\end{align*}
Using $(1)$ we get 
\begin{align*}
d(a_{n+1},a_{n+k})&<\theta^{n}\Delta+\theta^{n+1}\Delta+\dots + \theta^{n+k-3}\Delta+\theta^{n+k-2}\Delta\\
&= \theta^n\Delta \left(\theta^{0}+\theta^{1}+\dots + \theta^{k-3}+\theta^{k-2}\right)
\end{align*}
Using 
$$\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}x^i= \frac{1-x^{m}}{1-x}$$ we get 
\begin{align*}
d(a_{n+1},a_{n+k})&<\theta^n\Delta \frac{1-\theta^{k-1}}{1-\theta}
\end{align*}
For a given $\epsilon>0$ can we find a $n$ (for any $k\in\Pee$) such that $\theta^n\Delta \frac{1-\theta^{k-1}}{1-\theta}\leq \epsilon$?\\
Note that $\frac{1-\theta^{k-1}}{1-\theta}$ is bounded as $\theta <1$. So is $\Delta$. Hence, it suffice to take 
$$n\geq \left[\frac{\log {\epsilon}-\log{\Delta}-\log{(1-\theta^{k-1})}-\log {(1-\theta)}}{\log\theta}\right]$$
and the sequence is convergent.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white]
$\mathbf{43.1.}$ \textbf{Theorem}. Let $D$ be the collection of all points $(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)$ in $\Breal^n$ such that for $i\in\Pee_n$, $x_i$ is rational. Then $D$ is dense in $\Breal^n$. Hence, $\Breal^n$ contains a countable dense subset.
\end{tcolorbox}
Consider an arbitrary nonempty open subset $P$ in $\Breal^n$. Be $p$ a point in $P$.
We have
$$\exists\, \epsilon>0: N(p;\epsilon)\subset P$$
Consider another point $q$ in $N(p;\epsilon)$ such that for each $i\in\Pee_n$ we have $q_i=p_i-\frac{\epsilon}{n}$ (obvioulsy $d(p,q) = \frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{n}}<\epsilon$).\\
Suppose for a given $i\in\Pee_n$ we have $q_i<p_i$. Then by 
 Theorem $\mathbf{30.5.}$ (Density of rationals in the reals) there is a rational number $r_i$ such that $q_i<r_i<p_i$.\\
 The point $r= (r_1,r_2,\dots,r_n)$ will be in $N(p;\epsilon)$ and as  $N(p;\epsilon)\subset P$ we have $r\in P$. \\
The theorem is proven as for an arbitrary nonempty open set in $\Breal^n$ we are able to find a point $(r_1,r_2,\dots,r_n)$ in $\Breal^n$ such that for $i\in\Pee_n$, $r_i$ is rational and thus $r$ is an element of $D$.

$\mathbf{43.2.}$ \textbf{Theorem}. There exists a countable collection $\mathscr{B} = \{B_i:i\in\Pee\}$ of open subsets of $\Breal^n$ that have the following property.\\
If $U$ is open in $\Breal^n$ and $p\in U$, then there is a $B_i\in  \mathscr{B}$ such that
$$p\in B_i \subset U$$
Hence, each open set $ U \subset \Breal^n$ is the union of a countable subcollection of $\mathscr{B}$.
\end{tcolorbox}
From theorem $\mathbf{43.1}$ page $79$ we know that  $D$, the collection of all points $(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)$ in $\Breal^n$ such that for $i\in\Pee_n$, $x_i$ is rational, is dense in $\Breal^n$. \\\\
Consider the map $f:\Pee\rightarrow D\rightarrow \Breal^n$ such that $f(i)$ is an open  subset $A_i$ of $\Breal^n$ with $q_i\in D$ is also in $A_i$. Let's denote $\mathscr{A}=\{A_i:i\in\Pee\}$. By construction, $\mathscr{A}$ is countable.\\
Be $U$ an open set in $\Breal^n$ with an element $p\in U$.  $U$ is an nonempty open set in $\Breal_n$ hence, as $D$ is dense, there will be at least one element $q$ of $D$ which is also in $U$. We can associate (with the map $f$) an open subset $A_i\in \mathscr{A}$  such that $q\in A_i$ and have $q\in U\cap A_i$. 
Yet, $p$ is not necessary an element of $A_i$. We consider two cases:\\
$U\subset A_i$. In that case we can replace $A_i$ by the set $B_i=U$. This set contains both $p$ and $q$ and $B_i\subset U$.
\\\\
If $A_i\not \subset U$, consider the set $B_i= U\cup(U\cap A_i)$. This set will contain both $p$ and $q$  (see figure).

$\mathbf{43.3.}$ \textbf{Lindelöf Theorem for }$\mathbf{\Breal^n}$. Let $X$ be a subset of $\Breal^n$. Suppose that $\mathscr{B} $ is a collection of open subsets of $\Breal^n$ such that $\bigcup \mathscr{B}\supset X$. Then for some countable subcollections $\mathscr{B}^{*}\subset \mathscr{B} $,  $\bigcup \mathscr{B}^{*}\supset X$.
\end{tcolorbox}
First note that if $X=\varnothing$ then the theorem is true as $\varnothing$ is a subset of any set.\\
Also if $\mathscr{B}$ is a finite collection or countable, then it is countable and the theorem is anyway true with $\mathscr{B}^{*}=\mathscr{B}$.\\
So, be $\mathscr{B}$ an infinite, non-countable, collection of open subsets $B\in \mathscr{B}$. Be $B^{*}$ an arbitrary element of $\mathscr{B}$ such that $X\cap B^{*}\neq \varnothing$. $X\cap B^{*}$ has at least one point in $X$ and by theorem $\mathbf{43.1}$ we know that we can find a point $q$ (with all rational numbers as coordinates), which is also a point of $B^{*}$. As $q\in \Qiuu^n$ with $\Qiuu^n$ countable, there is a bijection $f:\Pee\rightarrow \Qiuu^n$  and can find a unique $i\in\Pee$ such that $f(i)=q$ and can label the set $B^{*}$ and put $B^{*}_i= B^{*}$. Let's put $X_{1,}=X$. Consider now $X_{2,i}= X_{1,}- ( X_{1,}\cap B^{*}_i)$.

Choose an arbitrary point $p^{'}\in X_{2,i}$ and a $B^{**}$ such that $p^{'}\in (X_{2,i}\cap B^{**})$. Consider the subset $ X_{2,i}\cap B^{**}$. As previously seen (notice that $p^{'}\not \in B^{*}_i$), this subset will contain an element $q_j\in \Qiuu^n$ and we can label the set $B^{**}$ and put $B^{*}_j= B^{**}$. The next step is than to consider $X_{3,j}= X_{2,i}-(X_{2,i}\cap B^{*}_j)$ and repeat the procedure i.e. choose an arbitrary point $p^{"}\in X_{3,j} $ and a $B^{***}\in\mathscr{B}$ such that $p^{"}\in (X_{3,j}\cap B^{***})$. Consider the set $X_{3,j}\cap B^{***}$. There will be a $q_k\in \Qiuu^n \Et \in X_{3,j}\cap B^{***}$ and we label $B^{*}_k= B^{***}$. Doing that recursively (see figure as illustration), as at each step $X$ is reduced in elements and knowing that every point in $X$ is covered by a open subset $B\in\mathscr{B}$, as long as $X_{m,k}$ is not an empty set, there will be a $B\in\mathscr{B}$ so that a point in $X_{m,k}$ is also in $B$. Hence, we will be able to "cover" $X$ with open subsets $B^{*}_m\in \mathscr{B}$ but for each of these subsets we can map a $m\in \Pee$ such that $\bigcup \mathscr{B^{*}}$ covers $X$ and hence
$$\mathscr{B^{*}}\text{ is countable and } X\subset \bigcup \mathscr{B^{*}}$$

$\mathbf{43.4.}$ \textbf{Heine-Borel Theorem}. Suppose that  $X$ is a bounded and closed subset of $\Breal^n$. Let $\mathscr{K} $ be  a collection of open subsets of $\Breal^n$ that covers $X$. Then some finite subcollection of  $\mathscr{K}$ also covers $X$.
\end{tcolorbox}
By the Lindelöf Theorem ($\mathbf{43.3.}$), we know that there is a countable subset $\mathscr{K}^{*}$ of $\mathscr{K}^{}$ that covers $X$. \\
Remember that in the proof of this theorem (see previous exercises) we had to choose for each $X_{m,k}$  a point $p\in X_{m,k}$ and a $K^{*}\in\mathscr{K}$ such that $p\in X_{m,k}\cap K^{*}$. By construction, the sets $\{X_{m,k}\},\, \{p\}\Et \{K^{*}\}$ were countable and thus we can label the elements in the sets and consider the three following (finite or infinite) sequences: $(X_m)$, $(p_m)$ and $(K^{*}_m)$ related with the following properties 
\begin{align}
X_{m+1}= X_m-\left(X_m\cap K^{*}_m \right),\quad p_m\in X_m\cap K^{*}_m,\ \quad 
\end{align}
Assumption: the sequences $(X_m)$, $(p_m)$ and $(K^{*}_m)$ are infinite.\\
\textit{( This means that $\forall m\in\Pee: X_{m} \neq\varnothing$ as otherwise the sequence by construction, would be finite.)}\\

We know that $X$ is bounded, hence the sequence $\left(p_{m}\right)$ will also be bounded and from theorem $\mathbf{41.4}$ page $76$ we know that there is a subsequence $\left(p_{n_m}\right)$ of $\left(p_{m}\right)$ that converges. Moreover, as $X$ is bounded and closed, by exercise $\mathbf{2.41.5}$ page $77$, we also know that the limit of this sequence will be in $X$.
So we have, considering the sub-sequences $(X_{n_m}),\, (p_{n_m})\Et (K^{*}_{n_m})$ (with $n_m$ a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers):\\\\
i) $\lim (p_{n_m})=p\in X$ means that we have
\begin{align}
\forall \epsilon>0,\, \exists\, N\in \Pee: d(p_{n_m},p)<\epsilon,\, n_m\geq N
\end{align}
ii) by $(1)$ each element $p_{n_m}\in X_{n_m}\cap K^{*}_{n_m}$  must also be in the open subset $K^{*}_{n_m}\in \mathscr{K}^{*}$, so:
\begin{align}
\exists\,\, \epsilon >0: N(p_{n_m};\epsilon)\subset K^{*}_{n_m}
\end{align}
iii) from $(2)$ and $(3)$ we can conclude that for a given $\epsilon>0$ and a $N\in\Pee$ we will have
\begin{align}
p\in N(p_{n_m};\epsilon) \text{  for }n_m\geq N \implies
\left\{\begin{array}{l }
 p\in  K^{*}_{n_m}\\
p_{n_m}\in N(p_{};\epsilon)
\end{array}\right.
\end{align}

Note that we also have $p\not \in X_{n_m},\, n_m\geq N$.\\ Indeed, suppose that we had $p\in X_{n_{m-1}}$, then as $p\in K^{*}_{n_{m-1}}$ we would have $p\in X_{n_{m-1}}\cap K^{*}_{n_{m-1}}$. So $p$ can't be an element of  $X_{n_{m}}$ as it is the result of the complement with respect to $X_{n_{m-1}}$ of the intersection of some $X_{k}$ and $K^{*}_{k},\ k=n_{m-1},n_{m-1}+1,\dots, n_{m}-1$:
$$ X_{n_{m}}=X_{n_{m-1}}- ( X_{n_{m-1}}\cap K^{*}_{n_{m-1}})- ( X_{n_{m-1}+1}\cap K^{*}_{n_{m-1}+1})- ( X_{n_{m-1}+2}\cap K^{*}_{n_{m-1}+2})-\dots - ( X_{n_{m}-1}\cap K^{*}_{n_{m}-1})$$
of which one contained $p$, so $p$ can not be an element of $X_{n_{m+1}}$.\\
We conclude
\begin{align*}
\left\{\begin{array}{l l}
p\in  K^{*}_{n_m}\\
&,\, n_m\geq N\\
p\not \in  X^{}_{n_m}
\end{array}\right.
\end{align*}
We also notice that $p$ is a limit point of $X_{n_{m}},\, n_m\geq N$. Indeed, we know that for $n_m\geq N$ we have by $(1)$ and $(4)$:
\begin{align*}
\forall\epsilon >0: \left(N(p;\epsilon)-\{p\}\right)\cap X_{n_m}=\{p_{n_m},\, \dots \}\neq \varnothing,\, n_m\geq N
\end{align*}
confirming that $p$ is not only the limit of the sequence $(p_{n_m})$ but also a limit point of $X^{}_{n_m}$ but not an element of it. Hence, $X^{}_{n_m}$ must be an open subset.\\
We know that $p\in K^{*}_{n_m},\, n_m\geq N$ and for the element $p_{n_m}$ we have $p\in N(p_{n_m};\epsilon)$ but we concluded that $X^{}_{n_m}$ is open subset with $p$ as a limit point but not an element of it, meaning that for the point $p_{n_m}\in X_{n_m}\cap K^{*}_{n_m}$ we have $\exists\,  \epsilon>0: N(p_{n_m};\epsilon)\subset X_{n_m}$. But $p\in N(p_{n_m};\epsilon)$. We get a contradiction as $p$ becomes a point of $X_{n_m} $ which we proved could not be.\\
As a matter of fact $X_{n_m}$ becomes an empty set as illustrated hereunder (starting with $X_{n_{m-1}}$, a closed susbet).

Conclusion: our assumption that the sequences $(X_m)$, $(p_m)$ and $(K^{*}_m)$ are infinite is incorrect and there must be some finite subcollection of  $\mathscr{K}$ that also covers $X$.

Suppose $\mathscr{B}$ is a collection of pairwise disjoint open subsets of $\Breal^n$. Show that $\mathscr{B}$ is a countable collection.
\end{tcolorbox}
We know from Theorem $\mathbf{43.1}$ that $\Qiuu^n$ is dense in $\Breal^n$.  This means:
$$\forall B\in\mathscr{B},\, \exists\, q\in \Qiuu^n: q\in B$$
As $\forall B,\, B^{'}\in\mathscr{B}: B\cap B^{'}=\varnothing$ it follows that if $q\in B$ then $q\not \in B^{'}$. We conclude that we can associate with each $B\in\mathscr{B}$ a unique element $q\in\Qiuu^n$ and as $\Qiuu^n$ is countable, $\mathscr{B}$ is countable.

Suppose that $K$ is an uncountable collection of real numbers.
Prove that there exists at least one $z \in K$ such that $z$ is a limit point of $K$. Prove that there is an uncountable collection of limit points of $K$ in $K$.
\end{tcolorbox}
Let's consider the statement 
$$\exists\, p\in\Breal:\forall\epsilon>0:\left(N(p;\epsilon)-\{p\}\right)\cap K\neq\varnothing$$
i.e. $K$ has at least one limit point.\\
Suppose $K$ has no limit point, then 
\begin{align*}
\neg\left(  \exists\, p\in\Breal:\forall\epsilon>0:\left(N(p;\epsilon)-\{p\}\right)\cap K\neq\varnothing\right)\\
\implies\quad \forall  p\in\Breal:\exists\,\epsilon>0:\left(N(p;\epsilon)-\{p\}\right)\cap K=\varnothing
\end{align*}
As this is for all $p\in\Breal$, choose an arbitrary point $p_1\in K\subset \Breal$. This means that there exists $\epsilon_1>0$ such that $N(p_1;\epsilon_1)$ does not contain other points of $K$ except $p_1$.\\
Let's put $K^*_1=N(p_1;\epsilon_1)$. All other points of $K$ will be in the set $K-K^*_1$.\\
Be 
$$p_2\in K-K^*_1 \text{ such that } p_2=\max(K^*_1\cap \left(-\infty, p_1)\right)$$
and 
$$p_3\in K-K^*_1\text{ such that }p_3=\min(K^*_1\cap \left(p_1,+\infty, )\right)$$
(i.e. choose the closest point left and right of $p_1$ that are elements of $K$).\\
As $p_2,\, p_3$ can't be limit points of of $K$ (by assumption), they also will have $\epsilon$-neighbourhoods that only contain themselves.\\
Put $$K^*_2=N(p_2;\epsilon_2)\Et K^*_3=N(p_3;\epsilon_3)$$
Continuing that way with 
$$p_4=\max\left( K-\left(K^*_1\cup K^*_2\cup K^*_3\right)\cap(-\infty,p_2)\right) \Et p_5=\min\left( K-\left(K^*_1\cup K^*_2\cup K^*_3\right)\cap(p_3,-\infty)\right)$$
we are able to construct a countable collection $\mathscr{K}=\{K^*_i:i\in\Pee\}$ of set, each containing only $1$ point of $K$. 
 \begin{figure}[H]%
    \centering
\input{./images/fig_2.44.1.tex}\\
\caption{$p_{2i}=\max\left( K-\left(K^*_1\cup K^*_2\cup \dots \cup K^*_{2i-1}\right)\cap(-\infty,p_{2i-2})\right) $}
\label{fig:fig_p8a}
\end{figure}
We prove that $\bigcup \mathscr{K}= K$.\\
Suppose $$\exists\, q_1\in K: q_1\not\in \bigcup \mathscr{K}$$
As $q_1$ can't be a limit point of $K$, $q_1$ has also an $\epsilon$-neighbourhood that contains no other point of $K$, except itself.\\
$q_1$ can not be between two points $p_i,\, p_k$ as constructed. Indeed, without loss of generality, suppose $p_i < q_1 < p_k$. Then there will be a $p_{k-1}\in \bigcup \mathscr{K}$ such that 
$p_i < q_1 < p_{k-1}< p_k$ as otherwise $q_1$ would have been the closest point to $p_k$ which was not an element of the $\epsilon$-neighbourhood of $p_k$ and hence, by construction would be an element of $\bigcup \mathscr{K}$.  Continuing that way we will arrive at a point where $p_i < q_1 < p_{i+1}$ which is not possible as otherwise $q_1$ would be the closest element near $p_{i+1}$ and again by construction would have been an element of $\bigcup \mathscr{K}$ and we conclude that $q_1$ can not be between two element of $\bigcup \mathscr{K}$. So $q_1$ must be either left or right of all elements of $\bigcup \mathscr{K}$.\\
Suppose $q_1$ is on the left of all point of $\bigcup \mathscr{K}$. As $q_1\in K$, $q_1$ is not a limit point (by assumption, $K$ has none) and so there exists an $\epsilon$-neighbourhood of $q_1$ that has only one element of $K$ i.e. $q_1$ itself. Furthermore, there must be another $q_2$ at the right of $q_1$ that is not an element of $\bigcup \mathscr{K}$ as otherwise $q_1$ would have been the closest element to one element of $\bigcup \mathscr{K}$. Continuing that way, as $K$ is infinite (uncountable), we can generate an infinite subset $Q=\{q_1,\, q_2,\, \dots\}$ that is bounded by all elements of $\bigcup \mathscr{K}$. By the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, this subset must have at least one limit point. But $Q\subset K$ which means that $Q$ can't have a limit point and we get a first contradiction and conclude $\nexists q_1\in K:\,  q_1 \not\in  \bigcup \mathscr{K}$ and thus 
$$\bigcup \mathscr{K}= K$$
and get the final contradiction as $K$ is uncountable while by construction $\bigcup \mathscr{K}= K$ is, so our  initial assumption that $K$ had no limit points was wrong.\\
\textbf{Conclusion:} $K$ has at least one limit point.
$$\lozenge$$
We have now to prove that some of the limit point are in $K$ and that there is an uncountable set of limit points of $K$ in $K$.\\

Let $\tilde{K}$ be the set of elements of $K$ that are not limit points of $K$ (which means that $K-\tilde{K}$ contains only limit points of  $K$ or is the empty set). Then for each $x \in \tilde{K}$ there exists $\epsilon_x > 0$ such that the neighbourhood $N(x;\,\epsilon_x)$ contains no other points of $K$ but $x$. The elements of the set of neighbourhoods $\{N(x;\,\epsilon_x) | x\in \tilde{K}\}$ are disjoint, and each contains a rational number (see $\mathbf{30.5}$ page $60$ - Density of rationals in the reals), so there can only be a countable number of them.\\
Hence $\tilde{K}$ is countable, and the set of limit points of $K$, which contains $K-\tilde{K}$, is uncountable.\\
Note that this also leads to the conclusion that $K-\tilde{K}\neq \varnothing$ as otherwise $K=\tilde{K}$ and $K$ would then be countable, which leads to a contradiction.\\\\
\textbf{Conclusion}: There is an uncountable collection of limit points of $K$ in $K$.

Suppose that $S\subset \Breal$ , $S\neq \varnothing$ and $S\neq \Breal$. Prove that $S$ is not both open and closed.
\end{tcolorbox}
Suppose $S \subset \Breal$ is nonempty and $S\neq \Breal$. Suppose further that $S$ is open and closed.\\ Let $p \in S$.  As $S \neq \Breal$, then there is some $q \in \sim S$.  Whithout loss of generality,  we can assume that $q > p$. Then the set $\tilde{S} = \{ x \in\, \sim S : x > p \}$ is bounded below (by $p$) and nonempty ($q \in \tilde S$). Therefore $\tilde{S}$ has a g.l.b. $m$ (see Exercise $2.30.1$ page $62$).\\\\
Can $m$ be in $S$ ?  Since $S$ is open, it contains an open neighbourhood $N(m;\epsilon)$. This contradicts the definition of $m = g.l.b. \, \tilde S$ , because $[m, m + \epsilon) \subset S$ and thus $m$ would not be the g.l.b. of $\tilde S$ \\\\
Suppose $m \not \in S$. Then since $S$ is closed, its complement $\sim S$ is open with $m\in\sim S $, therefore there is an open neighbourhood $N(m;\epsilon)$ contained in $\sim S$. Then $(m - \frac{\epsilon}{2},m]\subset N(m;\epsilon)$ contradicts the $g.l.b$ definition of $m$ as $m-\frac{\epsilon}{2}\not \in S$ and $> p$ (as otherwise $p$ would be in $N(m;\epsilon)$ which is not possible as $p\not\in \sim S$) and thus $m$ would not be the g.l.b. of $\tilde S$\\\\
It follows that $S = \Breal$.

Suppose that $K$ is a nonempty closed and bounded subset of $\Breal$. Do there exist points $x$ and $y$ in $K$  such that $d(x,y)) = diam (K)$?
\end{tcolorbox}
As $K$ is closed, by exercise $1$ page $77$, there exist sequences in $K$ that converge to a limit point (element of $K$).\\
Be $\tilde{x}_k,,\ \tilde{x}_m $ two limits points then
$$\begin{cases}
\lim x_k=\tilde{x}_k\\
\lim x_m=\tilde{x}_m\\
\end{cases}$$
We first prove that $$\lim d(x_k,x_m)= d(\tilde{x}_k ,\tilde{x}_m )$$
By the triangle inequality , we have 
\begin{align*}
&\begin{cases}
d(x_k,x_m)\leq d(x_k,\tilde{x}_k)+d(\tilde{x}_k,\tilde{x}_m)+d(\tilde{x}_m,x_m)\\
d(\tilde{x}_k,\tilde{x}_m)\leq d(\tilde{x}_k,x_k)+d(x_k,x_m)+d(x_m,\tilde{x}_m)
\end{cases}\\
\implies\quad
&\begin{cases}
d(x_k,x_m)-d(\tilde{x}_k,\tilde{x}_m)\leq d(x_k,\tilde{x}_k)+d(\tilde{x}_m,x_m)\\
d(x_k,x_m)-d(\tilde{x}_k,\tilde{x}_m)\geq -\left[ d(\tilde{x}_k,x_k)+d(x_m,\tilde{x}_m)\right]
\end{cases}\\
\implies\quad & \left|d(x_k,x_m)-d(\tilde{x}_k,\tilde{x}_m)\right| \leq d(x_k,\tilde{x}_k)+d(\tilde{x}_m,x_m)
\end{align*}
By the definition of the limit:
$$\forall\epsilon,\,\exists\, N\in\Pee: d(x_k,\tilde{x}_k)<\frac{\epsilon}{2}\Et d(x_m,\tilde{x}_m)<\frac{\epsilon}{2},\, k,\, m \geq N$$
and thus
$$\left|d(x_k,x_m)-d(\tilde{x}_k,\tilde{x}_m)\right| < \epsilon\quad k,\, m \geq N$$
and thus $d(x_k,x_m) $ converges to $d(\tilde{x}_k,\tilde{x}_m)$.\\
Consider the set $P=\{d(\tilde{x}_k,\tilde{x}_m)\}$. This set is a totally ordered set (with elements in $\Breal$) and bounded (by $diam\, K$) and thus has a maximal element $d(\tilde{x}_p,\tilde{x}_q)$.\\
Suppose $d(\tilde{x}_p,\tilde{x}_q)\neq \, diam \, K$, then as $diam\, K= l.u.b.\, d(x,y),\, x,y\in K$ there must be two element in $K$ such that
$$d(\tilde{x}_p,\tilde{x}_q)<d(x,y)\leq \, diam \, K$$
If $d(x,y)= \, diam \, K$, we are done. \\
If $d(x,y)\neq \, diam \, K$ then there must be other elements $x^{'},y^{'}$ such that 
$$d(\tilde{x}_p,\tilde{x}_q)<d(x,y)<d(x^{'},y^{'})\leq \, diam \, K$$
as long as $d(x^{'},y^{'})\neq \, diam \, K$ we will have 
$$d(\tilde{x}_p,\tilde{x}_q)<d(x,y)<d(x^{'},y^{'})<d(x^{''},y^{''})<\cdots \leq \, diam \, K$$
So we get a sequence in $\Breal$ such that $a_n<a_{n+1}$ and that is  bounded above. By Exercise $1$ page $64$, this sequence has a limit $d(x_0,y_0)= \, diam \, K$ meaning that $x_0\Et  y_0$  are limits of sequences of elements in $K$ so $x_0\Et  y_0$ are limits points of $K$ (by Exercise $1$ page $77$). As $K$ is closed, $x_0\Et y_0\, \in K$ en we can conclude that $$\exists x_0,\, y_0\,\in K: d(x_0, y_0)= \, diam\, K$$

Suppose that $M$ is a countable subset of $\Breal^2$ and $p\in \Breal^2-M$. Does there necessarily exist a line $L \subset\Breal^2$ such that $p\in L\subset \Breal^2-M$
\end{tcolorbox}
Yes, it exists.\\
By exercise $4$ page $51$ we know that if two sets $M_1$ and $M_2$ are countable sets than $M=M_1\times M_2$ is countable. So we can construct the given countable set $M\subset \Breal^2$ with two countable subset $M1,\, M2$ which are subsets of $\Breal$. \\
If a line $L\subset\,  \sim M$ exists, it will be a subset of $(\sim M_1)\times\,  (\sim M_2)$, $(\sim M_1)\times \Breal$ or $\Breal\times \, (\sim M_2)$.\\
Choose $p=(p_1,\, p_2): p_1\in \,\Breal\Et p_2 \in \,\sim M_2$. Obviously, the line will contain no point of $M$ because $L\subset \Breal\times \,( \sim M_2)$ and thus $L\subset\, (\sim M)$.
